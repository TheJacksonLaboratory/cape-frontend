# CAPE web Frontend

CAPE Web is a Single-Page Authentication Web Application used to interact with [CAPE Web Backend](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/cape-backend). It is a user interface meant to access the [CAPE analysis R package](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/cape) and it enables users to run analysis through the Webapp. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
